# Modelling assist

These Jupyter notebooks supplement teaching of key model design concepts.
- Calibration: parameter space, objective function, ad-hoc calibration, gradient descent calibration.
- Uncertainty: observation error, parameter uncertainty, priors and posteriors, forecasts and prediction uncertainty, structural error.
- Wairakei: examples of the above as applied to the Wairakei geothermal system.

## Getting Started

Download and unzip a local copy of this library. Open a Jupyter Notebook server and then open calibration/calibration.ipynb.

Alternatively, open it in Binder.
